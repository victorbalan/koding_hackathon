          h4.text-center You must have the acceleration and decideDirection functions and you need to leave everything else untouched if you want your car to work. Later on you may recieve your own engine that you can configure to make your car even better and beat your friends. :)
          h4.text-center Your car will do exactly what you coded it to do so be carefull, as in real life, there are rules on the road!
          br
          h4.text-center When you finished the car design, you will have to upload the file in the <a href="/garage">garage</a> page, click the "Add new car".

          h4.text-center Next you should test your car on the track, to see how is it behaving. You can do this on the <a href="/races">races</a> page.

          h4 When driving, road quality and weather affect you a lot. For example, you may encounter potholes on the road which will destroy your car if you don't slow down.
          h4 When racing, road quality is perfect, but you will still have to be considerate if the track is wet, frozen, iceberg etc.
